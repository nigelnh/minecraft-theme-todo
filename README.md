## 💭 Personal Note
I created this project because I wanted something that would make task management more engaging while paying homage to a game that defined my childhood. Minecraft has always been about building and creating, and this todo app brings that same spirit to organizing daily tasks. The familiar textures and pixelated aesthetics serve as a nostalgic reminder of the countless hours spent mining and crafting, now repurposed to help stay focused and productive.
